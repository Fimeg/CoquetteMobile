# 🚀 CoquetteMobile Expansion Plan: Desktop Coquette Patterns

## **Key Patterns from Desktop Coquette Analysis**

### **1. NewToolsAgent.ts Architecture**
- **Clean tool registry** with `Map<string, Tool>`
- **Standardized ToolResult interface** with success/error/metadata
- **Risk assessment and validation** per tool execution
- **Sophisticated tool chaining** capabilities with multi-step workflows

### **2. WorkflowPatterns.ts - Multi-Step Orchestration**
```typescript
// 5-step software engineering workflow pattern:
1. Understand → Analyze request and understand context
2. Plan → Build coherent execution plan  
3. Implement → Execute plan using available tools
4. Verify (Tests) → Run tests to verify functionality
5. Verify (Standards) → Run linting/type-checking for quality
```
- **Workflow state management**: pending/in_progress/completed/failed
- **Step-by-step execution** with metadata tracking
- **Error recovery** and fallback mechanisms

### **3. IntelligenceRouter.ts - AI-Driven Routing**
- ⚠️ **NO hardcoded keyword matching** - all decisions made by AI
- **Model selection** with reasoning, confidence, complexity levels
- **Context-aware routing** based on conversation history
- **Multi-model intelligence** coordination

### **4. Tool Safety & Permission Patterns**
```typescript
// Desktop safety patterns:
shouldConfirmExecute() // For dangerous operations
toolLocations()        // Show affected file paths  
Risk levels: LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH // With approval workflows
validateToolParams()   // Parameter validation
getDescription()       // Pre-execution description
```

## **Mobile Tools Implementation Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Web & Content Tools** 🌐
```kotlin
WebFetchTool + ExtractorTool + SummarizerTool
```
**Capabilities:**
- "What's on Hacker News?" → fetch → extract → summarize
- "Latest news about AI" → search → fetch multiple → summarize
- "Read this article for me" → fetch → extract → discuss

**Safety Features:**
- Privacy controls (no private IPs, user confirmation)
- Content length limits (100KB max like desktop)
- URL validation and sanitization
- User approval for external requests

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Mobile Context** 📱
```kotlin
ContactsTool + CalendarTool + LocationTool + CameraTool
```
**Capabilities:**
- "Schedule lunch with Sarah tomorrow" → contacts → calendar
- "What's nearby?" → location → places → recommendations  
- "Take a photo and analyze it" → camera → vision → description
- "Call my mom" → contacts → phone integration

**Safety Features:**
- Permission-gated with user approval
- Privacy controls for location/contacts
- Camera access with explicit consent
- No automatic actions without confirmation

### **Phase 3: Advanced Workflows** 🧠
```kotlin
// Multi-step workflows like desktop's 5-step pattern:
1. Understand (analyze user intent with context)
2. Plan (choose tools & sequence using planner model) 
3. Execute (run tool chain with progress tracking)
4. Verify (check results and validate success)
5. Present (natural conversation with personality model)
```

**Advanced Features:**
- **Tool chaining**: WebFetch → Extract → Summarize → Store → Notify
- **Context retention**: Remember tool results across conversations
- **Proactive suggestions**: "Your battery is low, enable power saving?"
- **Background monitoring**: Silent health checks and alerts

### **Phase 4: File & System Integration** 📁
```kotlin
FileTool + NotificationTool + SettingsTool + AppLauncherTool
```
**Capabilities:**
- "Show me my recent photos" → FileTool.listFiles → display
- "Set a reminder for 3pm" → CalendarTool → NotificationTool
- "Turn on Do Not Disturb" → SettingsTool.setMode
- "Open Spotify" → AppLauncherTool.launch

## **Implementation Strategy**

### **Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Implement WebFetchTool** following desktop patterns
2. **Add ExtractorTool** for HTML → readable text conversion
3. **Create SummarizerTool** using deepseek-r1:32b for long content
4. **Test tool chaining**: URL → HTML → Text → Summary → Conversation

### **Architecture Improvements:**
1. **Enhanced PlannerService** with desktop-style reasoning
2. **Tool validation pipeline** with safety checks
3. **Permission management system** for sensitive operations
4. **Workflow state tracking** for multi-step operations

### **Desktop Coquette Features to Adapt:**
- **Risk assessment framework** for tool operations
- **Approval workflows** for dangerous/sensitive actions  
- **Tool discovery patterns** for dynamic tool loading
- **Error recovery mechanisms** with fallback strategies
- **Context-aware tool selection** based on conversation flow

## **Success Metrics**

🎯 **Core Goals:**
- **Zero security vulnerabilities** in tool implementations
- **Sub-3-second response times** for tool chains
- **100% local privacy** for sensitive operations  
- **Better UX than Google Assistant** for power users
- **Desktop Coquette feature parity** for mobile use cases

## **Long-term Vision**

Transform CoquetteMobile into a **sophisticated AI assistant ecosystem** that:
- Rivals desktop Coquette's capabilities on mobile
- Maintains complete privacy and local control
- Provides advanced tool orchestration and workflow automation
- Enables complex multi-step AI-powered tasks
- Serves as a foundation for AI-native mobile workflows
