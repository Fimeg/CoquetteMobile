# üöÄ CoquetteMobile: Next Steps & Tool Testing Plan

## Immediate Testing Priorities

### 1. **Connection Stability Testing** 
- Test background persistence - switch apps, lock screen, wait 5+ minutes
- Verify "Software caused connection abort" is fixed
- Test streaming responses during network fluctuations
- Monitor foreground service notification behavior

### 2. **Think Tag Real-time Display**
- Test streaming with `<think>` content in deepseek-r1:32b responses
- Verify thinking appears live during generation
- Test collapsible thinking sections in UI
- Confirm thinking content persists in conversation history

### 3. **Tool System Validation**
- Test device context queries: "What's my battery status?"
- Verify tool keyword detection works properly
- Test MobileToolsAgent planning with gemma3n:e4b
- Validate tool results display in chat

## Next Implementation Phase

### 4. **Enhanced Mobile Tools** üì±
```kotlin
// Priority order for new tools:
1. CameraTool - Photo capture and analysis
2. LocationTool - GPS context (privacy-conscious)
3. FileTool - Local file operations
4. ContactsTool - Contact lookup/management
5. CalendarTool - Schedule integration
6. NotificationTool - System notification management
```

### 5. **Advanced AI Features** üß†
- **Multi-step reasoning**: Chain multiple tools together
- **Context persistence**: Remember tool results across conversations  
- **Proactive suggestions**: "Your battery is low, should I enable power saving?"
- **Background monitoring**: Silent health checks and alerts

### 6. **UI/UX Enhancements** ‚ú®
- **Voice input/output**: Speech-to-text and TTS integration
- **Quick actions**: Floating bubble for instant access
- **Gesture controls**: Voice activation, shake to wake
- **Dark mode refinements**: Better thinking tag visibility

### 7. **Performance Optimizations** ‚ö°
- **Model routing intelligence**: Auto-select best model per task type
- **Response caching**: Cache common device queries
- **Streaming optimizations**: Reduce latency, improve chunk handling
- **Memory management**: Efficient conversation pruning

## Testing Scenarios

### **Tool Integration Tests**
```
‚úÖ "What's my device status?" ‚Üí DeviceContextTool
‚úÖ "Check my battery" ‚Üí Battery info subset  
‚úÖ "How much storage do I have?" ‚Üí Storage analysis
‚è≥ "Take a photo of this" ‚Üí CameraTool (pending)
‚è≥ "Where am I?" ‚Üí LocationTool (pending)
‚è≥ "Find my photos from yesterday" ‚Üí FileTool (pending)
```

### **Privacy Validation**
- Confirm no data leaves device except to local Ollama
- Test airplane mode functionality (local tools only)
- Verify personality storage is device-local
- Test conversation export/import for user control

### **Real-world Usage**
- Daily driver testing: Replace Google Assistant workflows
- Battery impact assessment with background service
- Network usage monitoring (should be minimal)
- Performance on various Android devices

## Success Metrics

üéØ **Core Goals:**
- Zero connection drops during normal usage
- Sub-2-second response times for device queries
- Thinking content visible within 500ms of generation
- All personal data stays 100% local
- Better UX than Google Assistant for privacy-conscious users
